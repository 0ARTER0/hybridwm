# HYBR!DWM
Window manager for wayland writen on rust.
Probably its be a sway like wm(i like sway) because sway is cool, 
but i dont like what he can't a run waybar and wofi with this "-c ~/path/config.jsonc -s ~/path/style.css" 
and if you say why just don't use hyprland? I will say static workpaces(yeah i also like bspwm and dwm(who make this, realy, but its cool)).
So i want to make my own wm with all this. This is why is a hybrid window manager, its need to be realy customizible and easy to use(just some configs line in hyprland).
If i realy post updates on github its be cool ;) .
